## Introduction

The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project focuses on investigating the relationship between greenhouse gas emissions and carbon capture and storage activities. The aim is to gain insights into the trends, patterns, and potential impact of these environmental factors, contributing to a deeper understanding of climate-related data and initiatives.

## Features

- Explore historical trends and patterns in greenhouse gas emissions data.
- Analyze regional variations and correlations in greenhouse gas emissions.
- Investigate carbon capture and storage methods and their impact on reducing emissions.
- Assess the effectiveness and limitations of carbon storage facilities.
- Visualize data using graphs, charts, and maps to enhance understanding and insights.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the analysis scripts, you need to have Python installed on your system. The scripts are compatible with Python 3. Additionally, you need to have the Prophet library and pandas installed.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
    git clone git@github.com:LardexTheLarge/AI-Project-1.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
    cd AI-Project-1
```

3. Run scripts inside each notebook.

4. Create your own EDA notebooks

## Usage

1. Open the CCS project file.
2. Run each notebook with the "run all" button.

## Documentation

The code is documented with inline comments to explain its functionality. You can refer to the comments in the code for details on how it works.
